ChemDoodle_WebComponents is a powerful javascript library for chemistry
featuring a large number of tools created by Kevin Theisen from ChemDoodle 
and released under the GPL licensing.

My main interest when modifying this code was center around 2D canvas and 
around jquery-ui. A live implementation of this modified code can be seen
on http://www.lewisdots.com/ChemPaint/

ChemDoodle Web Components unmodified by me can be obtained from 
http://web.ChemDoodle.com/installation. This site should also be your main source
of information if you decide to join in and fork/modify this library. If you want
to modify the original or perhaps develop a plugin then get the sources from the 
above url. 

One important thing! It would only be proper if you give prominent credit to 
ChemDoodle Web Components in whatever you use it for.
