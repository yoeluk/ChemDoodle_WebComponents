ChemDoodle_WebComponents is a wonderful javascript library created by 
Kevin Theisen from ChemDoodle and released under the GPL licensing.

My main interest when modifying this code was center around 2D canvas and 
around jquery-ui. A live implementation of this modified code can be seen
on http://www.lewisdots.com/ChemPaint/

ChemDoodle Web Components in its published form can be access on 
http://web.ChemDoodle.com/installation. These should also be your main source
of information if you decide to join in and fork this library. If you want to
the original or perhaps develop a plugin then get the sources from the above 
url. 

One important thing! Clearly this library was not a small effort and therefore 
it would only be proper if you give prominent credit to ChemDoodle Web Components
in whatever you use it for.
